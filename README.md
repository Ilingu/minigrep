# [MINIGREP]: grep command but simplified

This repo is the result of [`Chapter 12 of the Rust Book`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/ch12-05-working-with-environment-variables.html)

Except that I didn't follow the tutorial at all; done it by myself from the ground up. (In mine there are colors ðŸŒˆ)
